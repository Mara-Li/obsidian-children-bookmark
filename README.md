# Bookmarks children

The plugin allows to quickly bookmarks the children of a folder.

Folder will be created in group recursively, removing the "parent" of the folder.

For example, adding `folder1/folder2/file.md` :
- By clicking and adding from folder1, all the structure will be recreated in the bookmarks.
- By clicking on `folder2`, only folder2 will be created in the bookmarks.

By default, the bookmarks will be added in the root, and it won't change.
Also, the order of the structure don't be saved if you readd the same folder.

Bookmarks api is a mess to deal with, so feel free to improve!
